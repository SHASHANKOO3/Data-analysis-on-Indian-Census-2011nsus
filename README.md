# Data-analysis-on-Indian-Census-2011
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing the Indian Census 2011 dataset, which was originally sourced from Wikipedia and stored in an Excel file. The dataset was then imported into an Oracle Database for further analysis.

Objectives
The main goal of this project is to extract valuable insights from census data by leveraging various Oracle SQL queries ranging from basic to advanced levels.

Key SQL Concepts Used
To analyze the dataset effectively, I utilized the following Oracle SQL techniques:

âœ… SELECT Queries â€“ To retrieve data from tables.
âœ… AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS â€“ Used functions like AVG, SUM, and COUNT to perform calculations on groups of data.
âœ… GROUP BY Clause â€“ To categorize data based on state-wise demographics.
âœ… INNER JOIN â€“ To combine data from multiple tables (Data1 and Data2) based on common fields like District.
âœ… FILTERING CONDITIONS â€“ Applied WHERE, HAVING, and ORDER BY to refine the dataset.
âœ… TOP N ANALYSIS â€“ Used FETCH FIRST N ROWS ONLY to get the top or bottom-ranked states based on various parameters.
âœ… MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS â€“ Derived total male and female populations using logical formulas based on sex ratio.

Data Insights Extracted
Using these queries, I extracted and analyzed various demographic details such as:

ðŸ“Œ State-wise population distribution
ðŸ“Œ Top & bottom states based on growth rate, literacy rate, and sex ratio
ðŸ“Œ Overall literacy rate and total literate vs. non-literate population
ðŸ“Œ State-wise male and female population calculation

Conclusion
By leveraging Oracle SQL, I successfully performed data extraction, transformation, and analysis on Indian Census 2011 data. The project demonstrates efficient database querying and manipulation skills, making it a great example of SQL-driven data analysis.
